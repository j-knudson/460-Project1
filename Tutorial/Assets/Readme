These assets are needed to run the game. 

For Version 2 of the game:

  Install the Player.png and Enemy.png in the directory and file where your pygame project is saved

  Lines 33 and 50 are the lines where the image location is used and can be adjusted to in your local version 
  (line 33)   self.image = pygame.image.load("Enemy.png")
  (line 50)   self.image = pygame.image.load("Player.png")
